# Machine Learning

    Since the major part of the project is going to be machine learning. 
    Thus, I have created a dedicated location to store all the machine learning code for the project.

## Task List

- [x] Initialise the project with a readme file.
- [] Add the main python file and start writing code.
- [] Add requirements.txt and licenses.csv file for ease of use.
- [] Start training and optimising the model.
- [] Convert the model to a core ml format so that it can be used in the application.

## Requirements

### test.py
- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- sklearn

### How to install 
- All these dependencies can be easily installed by using anaconda in Mac or Windows or Linux.
- An alternative to Anaconda is pip. The command pip can be used in the following way
    `pip install package_name`
    
## Compilation Instructions
- First ensure that all the required libraries have been **installed**. 
- Open the terminal emulator or command prompt and type the command `python file_name`
