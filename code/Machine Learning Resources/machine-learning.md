# Machine Learning

    Since the major part of the project is going to be machine learning. Thus, I have created a dedicated location to store all the machine learning code for the project.

## Task List

- [x] Initialise the project with a readme file.
- [] Add the main python file and start writing code.
- [] Add requirements.txt and licenses.csv file for ease of use.
- [] Start training and optimising the model.
- [] Convert the model to a core ml format so that it can be used in the application.
