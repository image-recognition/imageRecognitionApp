# Monday, Week 6, 8 April
- This project is seriously behind.
- You both need a minimum 2 days per week to pass under normal circumstances. More for you two.
- I need to get serious with you here: To catch up, you'll need to do much more. If you're not intending to pass, look into withdrawing from the unit and trying again next year.
- Both of you: function comments. I made a big fuss about this on the unit site last week. [Henry]
