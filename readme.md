# Project Overview
	The main objective of the project is to design an iOS based app which implements the concepts of Augmented Reality and Machine Learning. The app will use the camera of the device to identify the object that has been placed in front of it. Furthermore, the user will be able to view all the recently identified items in the form of a list and custom lists can also be created by the user.

	The project will be compatible with iOS devices and I am aiming for High Distinction.
