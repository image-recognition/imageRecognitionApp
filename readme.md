# Project Overview
	The main objective of the project is to design an iOS based app which implements the concepts of Augmented Reality and Machine Learning. The app will use the camera of the device to identify the object that has been placed in front of it. Furthermore, the user will be able to view all the recently identified items in the form of a list and custom lists can also be created by the user.

	The project will be compatible with iOS devices and I am aiming for High Distinction.

# Compile Instructions
    The app is currently working with limited capabilities. The instructions to build it are as follows:
- An iOS device (as the application uses camera view which cannot be used on a simulator) is required to run the application.

- Clone the repo onto your local machine by using
	```
		git clone https://github.com/image-recognition/imageRecognitionApp.git
	```
- Open the Project in Xcode.

- After, the project has been opened click on the play button on the top left corner of Xcode.

- Click on the prompt to allow camera permissions to the device.

# Directory Layout
The project at the moment consists of two folders and they are:
- ImageRecognitionApp [main application folder].
- Machine Learning Resources [to test out some code].

## ImageRecognitionApp
	This folder contains the code for the core application and can be compiled using the instructions listed in under the Compile Instructions header.

## Machine Learning Resources
	This folder contains some test code for Machine Learning written in Python.
